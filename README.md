# rnn-sentiment-analysis

RNN-based sentiment analysis project (UCSC NLP).

Designed and implemented an end-to-end deep learning sentiment analysis system using an RNN architecture. Built a full NLP pipeline including preprocessing, embedding, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and quantitative evaluation across multiple performance metrics.

Originally developed as part of an NLP course at UC Santa Cruz and expanded into a portfolio project.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Deep learning model implementation (RNN)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Python / PyTorch or TensorFlow
